# i3wm
After struggling to find a solution for a Window Manager after Fluxbox,I decided to give i3 a go. I've always been a fan of the minimalist setup. Way back when, Fluxbox and Blackbox were my goto. They both were highly customizable and used little to nothing on resources which made them snappy. i3 seem to have picked up right where they left off. I think I'll be sticking to this one.
